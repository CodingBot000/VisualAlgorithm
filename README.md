It visually represents the operation of the algorithm. 
Pause and resume are possible during playback.
While paused, you can track the history of the algorithm's operations using back and forward buttons. 
Each time you enter the screen, data is randomly extracted, allowing you to see the algorithm operating on different elements every time.
