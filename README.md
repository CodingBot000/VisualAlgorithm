<h1 align="center">VisualAlgorithm</h1>

<p align="center">  
 This ToyProject make modern Android development with Compose, Dagger-Hilt, Coroutines, Jetpack based on MVI architecture.
</br>
</br>
It visually represents the operation of the algorithm. 
<ul>
<li>Pause and resume are possible during playback.</li>
<li>While paused, you can track the history of the algorithm's operations using back and forward buttons.</li>
<li>Each time you enter the screen, data is randomly extracted, allowing you to see the algorithm operating on different elements every time.</li>
 <li>Can track the log and view it through the bottom sheet bar.</li>
 </ul>
